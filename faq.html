      <h1>General</h1>
      <div class="faq">
        <details>
          <summary>Q: What is Clairity?</summary>
          <p>
            Clairity is a portable indoor air-quality (IAQ) assessment and
            monitoring system that measures CO₂, VOCs, temperature, and humidity
            in individual rooms. It provides data-driven insights without
            requiring building Wi-Fi, IT involvement, or permanent installation.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Q: Who is Clairity designed for?</summary>
          <p>
            Clairity is designed for schools, commercial buildings, small
            businesses, property managers, medical offices, and facility
            operators who need room-level environmental data to evaluate
            ventilation, occupant comfort, and HVAC performance.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Q: How does Clairity work?</summary>
          <p>
            Each portable sensor logs environmental data locally for 24–72 hours
            (or continuously for monitoring deployments). Data is processed
            through Clairity’s offline pipeline and interpreted in a structured,
            evidence-based report and dashboard.
          </p>
        </details>
      </div>
      <h1>Deployment &amp; Setup</h1>
      <div class="faq">
        <details>
          <summary>Q: Do I need building Wi-Fi or IT approval?</summary>
          <p>
            No. Clairity operates on an isolated network using its own travel
            router. It does not interact with building networks or systems, so
            IT approval is typically not required.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Q: How long does setup take?</summary>
          <p>
            Portable sensors generally require less than 2 minutes per room. You
            place the device, connect power, and it begins logging
            automatically.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Q: Is installation permanent?</summary>
          <p>
            No. There is no drilling, mounting, wiring, or HVAC integration. All
            equipment is portable and can be relocated or removed without
            altering the building.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Q: How many sensors do I need?</summary>
          <p>
            One sensor per room is recommended to capture accurate room-specific
            ventilation and occupancy patterns. Larger or unusually complex
            rooms may benefit from additional sensors.
          </p>
        </details>
      </div>
      <h1>Audit Process</h1>
      <div class="faq">
        <details>
          <summary>Q: How long does an audit take?</summary>
          <p>
            Most audit cycles run 24–72 hours, depending on building size,
            occupancy patterns, and the variability of airflow and ventilation
            conditions.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Q: When will I receive results?</summary>
          <p>
            Most reports are delivered within 1–3 days after equipment pickup,
            depending on the number of rooms and the complexity of the analysis.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Q: What does an IAQ audit include?</summary>
          <p>
            A standard audit includes: <br />– CO₂ pattern analysis and
            ventilation adequacy <br />– VOC exposure patterns and source
            inference <br />– Temperature and humidity stability evaluation
            <br />– Time-of-day environmental trends <br />– Occupancy influence
            modeling <br />– Room-level recommendations for ventilation,
            scheduling, filtration, or operational adjustments
          </p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Q: Do you measure mold?</summary>
          <p>
            Clairity does not directly measure mold spores. Instead, it
            identifies environmental conditions that correlate with elevated
            mold risk (humidity cycles, stagnant air patterns, and condensation
            risk) and provides recommendations to reduce that risk.
          </p>
        </details>
      </div>
      <h1>Technical Specifications</h1>
      <div class="faq">
        <details>
          <summary>Q: What metrics do the sensors track?</summary>
          <p>
            Clairity sensors track: <br />– CO₂ concentration <br />– Total VOC
            index <br />– Temperature (°C/°F) <br />– Relative humidity <br />–
            Air-change proxy indicators derived from CO₂ decay curves
          </p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Q: How accurate are the sensors?</summary>
          <p>
            Clairity uses industry-validated non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) CO₂
            sensors and metal-oxide VOC sensors that are calibrated for
            long-term stability and consistent performance in occupied spaces.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>
            Q: Do sensors store data if internet is unavailable?
          </summary>
          <p>
            Yes. All data logging is offline by design. Sensors store
            measurements locally, and internet connectivity is not required for
            normal operation.
          </p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Q: What power source do the sensors use?</summary>
          <p>
            Sensors run on low-voltage power, typically via USB-C or a
            compatible battery bank, depending on the deployment model. This
            makes them safe and easy to deploy in classrooms and offices.
          </p>
