            About Clairity
        </h1>
        <p>
            Clairity exists to make indoor air quality understandable, measurable, and manageable for every school and
            small building—not just large institutions with enterprise budgets.
            <br><br>
            We believe that healthy air is essential for learning, comfort, and performance, and that every building
            deserves access to clear data, not assumptions.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section style="background-color: #FAFAFA;" class="expl">
        <h1>Who We Are</h1>
        <p>
            Clairity was founded in Texas by Milan Chandran, a senior at Allen High School who saw first-hand how
            inconsistent classroom air quality affected comfort, focus, and performance.
            <br><br>
            While working across school labs, HVAC spaces, and independent electronics projects, Milan realized a simple
            truth:
            Most classrooms and offices have hidden ventilation problems—yet no one has the data to see them.
            <br><br>
            Instead of accepting that,<b> he built a solution.</b>
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="expl">
        <h1>Our Approach</h1>
        <ul>
            <p>Clairity combines portable sensors, offline-capable data logging, and a clean, visual dashboard that
                transforms complex air-quality data into simple, actionable insights.
                <br><br>
                We focus specifically on environments like:
            </p>
            <li>Schools & districts</li>
            <li>Offices and workspaces</li>
            <li>Gyms and small facilities</li>
            <li>Property-managed buildings</li>
            <li>Clinics and educational environments</li>
            <br>
            <p>These are buildings that traditionally struggle to access affordable, room-level IAQ monitoring.
                <br><br>
                Clairity changes that.
            </p>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section style="background-color: #FAFAFA;" class="expl">
        <ul>
            <p>
                Many building technologies are developed by large companies far removed from the realities of classrooms
                and small facilities.
                <br><br>
                Clairity was built from the ground up with:
            </p>
            <li>first-hand experience inside classrooms, labs, and HVAC spaces</li>
            <li>a direct understanding of how staff and students experience the environment</li>
            <li>a practical, engineering-driven mindset</li>
            <li>respect for school budgets and operational constraints</li>
            <br><br>
            <p>Instead of developing technology for “ideal conditions,” Clairity was designed for real buildings—tight
                budgets, aging HVAC, mixed ventilation patterns, and busy administrators.
            </p>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section class="expl">
        <h1>Built in Texas</h1>
        <p>Clairity is based in Texas and shaped by the challenges of local schools and small commercial buildings.<br>
            Every feature—from offline data logging to portable sensors to simple reporting—was designed to fit the needs of
            real facilities in the region.</p>
    </section>
    <section style="background-color: #FAFAFA;" class="expl">
        <h1>The Story Continues</h1>
        <p>Clairity is actively partnering with schools, small businesses, and local districts to bring room-level air
            data to more environments.
            <br><br>
            As the platform grows, so does our commitment to practical, affordable indoor air intelligence.
            <br><br>
